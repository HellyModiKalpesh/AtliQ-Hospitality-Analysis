**Realization & Cancellations**
Realization Rate: 70.14% across properties.
Cancellation Rate: Ranges between 24-26%, with spikes close to booking dates that impact room resale opportunities.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Benchmark Best Performers**
Action: Analyze successful properties like AtliQ Exotica to identify factors (e.g., pricing strategy, customer base) that could benefit other properties.

2. **Tailored Marketing Campaigns**
Action: Create city-specific marketing plans, particularly for high-revenue areas like Mumbai and Bangalore, to capitalize on market strengths and boost occupancy in low-performing regions.

3. **Seasonal Promotions**
Action: Launch discounts, weekend packages, and holiday offers to increase occupancy during low-demand periods.

4. **Dynamic Pricing Strategy**
Action: Implement dynamic pricing that adjusts rates based on competitor pricing and guest demand, especially during peak seasons.

5. **Flexible Booking Policies**
Action: Introduce non-refundable discounts or stricter policies during high-demand periods to reduce cancellations, while offering last-minute deals to fill canceled rooms quickly.

6. **Increase Direct Bookings**
